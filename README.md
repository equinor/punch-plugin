# punch-plugin
Plugin to handle ProCoSys Punch

The wrapping application must handle authorization and get hold of the punches.
This plugin takes a list of punch as input and takes care of rendering and signing them.
It also has a component for creating new punches

It is written in Elm, but meant to be comsumed by anyone. Does not matter if you use React, Angular or Elm
